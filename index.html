		<h1>Cooling</h1>
		<p>
			Central air conditioning helps keep your environment cool and reduces humidity levels. As the central air conditioning system draws air out<br>
			of various rooms in your house or business through return air ducts, the air is pulled through an air filter, which removed airborne particles<br>
			such as dust and lint. The filtered air is then routed to air supply ductwork that carries it back to the rooms.</p>
